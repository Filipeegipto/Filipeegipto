  - [Monitor Server](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/monitor-server): Included new endpoints, modules, and DB tables to support the developments made on the rest of the ecosystem tools. Technologies used: NestJS, TypeScript, JavaScript, MySQL.
  - [Observatory Apps](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/observatory-apps): Created the first applications accessibility observatory, a new tool to include in the ecosystem. Technologies used: React, JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS.
  - [Access Monitor Rulesets](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/accessmonitor-rulesets): Created a list of solutions to the different problems the ecosystem evaluation tool is able to identify ([Access Monitor Plus](https://accessmonitor.acessibilidade.gov.pt)). Technologies used: Markdown.
  MSc. projects:
  - [PLush Compiler](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/PLush_Compiler): The main idea of this project was to develop a compiler for a language (PLush), created by the professor to easy the initial learning of how to write code for 1st year BSc. students. Technologies used: Python, Shell script, Clang, PLush.
  BSc. projects:
  - [MigrantMatcher](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/MigrantMatcher): The main idea of this project was to provide a simple application for migrants and volunteers, where migrants could search for a place to stay or diverse items, and volunteers could provide either housing or items for migrants. Technologies used: Java, JUnit.
  - [Democracia2](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/CSS-Project_Democracia2): The main idea of this project was to create a software that had many properties such as security, privacy, performance scalability, integration with other government systems, etc. The project consisted of building a software where people could vote in order to reduce the amount of abstention. Technologies used: Java, JavaFX, HTML, JUnit, Spring, JPA, Docker and Postgres.
  - [Game Store](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/PSI-Project_Game-Store): The main idea of this project was to create a system which gives more visibility to the products and allows for a bigger interaction between its players. To complete this project, it was fundamental to follow a software development methodology inspired in the Kanban methodology. Technologies used: Angular, TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, CSS and MongoDB.
  - [Tintolmarket](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/SC-Project_Tintolmarket): The main idea of this project was to develop a wine shop. The project was divided in 2 phases: On the first phase, the functionalities of the service were developed, leaving the web application functional, however, with no security. On the second one, the security aspects were taken into account so that the interactions and the whole system were safe. Technologies used: Java and Gradle.
  - [SD Project](https://github.com/Filipeegipto/SD-Project): The main idea of this project was to make a key-value pair storage service similar to the one used by Amazon to support its web services. This way, the data structure used to store this information was a binary-search tree given its high efficiency on the search level. Technologies used: C, Apache ZooKeeper, and Makefile.
